# hello-world

Just a novice trying to gain programming knowledge


I have no idea what I'm doing. All I know is I'm expanding on my childhood
desire for learning how to program.

I have no idea what language to even start with, just that I'm desperate to start
learning and to do so the right way the first time around.

Any help/advice is much appreciated!
